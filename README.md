## 🧠 About the Machine Learning Model

The emotion detection is powered by a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. It processes journal entries and questionnaire responses to classify emotions such as happy, sad, anxious, angry, and more.

You can download the pre-trained ML model from Google Drive:
